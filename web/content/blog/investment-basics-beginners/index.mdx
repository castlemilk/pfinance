Investing might seem intimidating, but it doesn't have to be. This guide will walk you through the basics so you can start building wealth with confidence. No finance degree required.

## Why Invest?

### Beat Inflation

Money sitting in a savings account loses purchasing power over time. With inflation averaging 3% historically, $100 today will only buy $74 worth of goods in 10 years. Investing helps your money grow faster than inflation.

### Build Wealth Over Time

Thanks to compound growth, money invested early can grow exponentially:

| Age Started | Monthly Investment | Value at 65 |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 25 | $200 | $632,000 |
| 35 | $200 | $294,000 |
| 45 | $200 | $124,000 |

*Assumes 8% average annual return*

That's over $500,000 difference just by starting 20 years earlier!

### Reach Financial Goals

Investing helps you achieve goals that saving alone can't:
- Retirement
- Home down payment
- Children's education
- Financial independence

## Before You Start Investing

### Prerequisites Checklist

Before putting money in the market, make sure you have:

1. **Emergency fund**: 3-6 months of expenses saved
2. **High-interest debt paid off**: Any debt above 7% interest should be prioritized
3. **Stable income**: Consistent money coming in
4. **Basic budget**: Know where your money goes (PFinance can help!)

<Callout type="warning">
Don't skip the emergency fund! Investing money you might need soon forces you to sell at potentially bad times, locking in losses.
</Callout>

### Investment Timeline

How soon will you need this money?

| Time Horizon | Appropriate Investments |
|--------------|------------------------|
| 0-2 years | High-yield savings, CDs |
| 2-5 years | Conservative mix of bonds and stocks |
| 5-10 years | Balanced portfolio |
| 10+ years | Growth-focused, stock-heavy portfolio |

## Basic Investment Concepts

### Stocks

When you buy a stock, you own a tiny piece of a company. If the company does well, your stock becomes more valuable. Some stocks also pay dividends—regular cash payments to shareholders.

**Risk Level**: Higher
**Potential Return**: Higher

### Bonds

Bonds are loans you make to companies or governments. They pay you interest over time and return your principal at maturity.

**Risk Level**: Lower
**Potential Return**: Lower

### Mutual Funds

A mutual fund pools money from many investors to buy a diversified mix of stocks and/or bonds. Professional managers make the investment decisions.

**Pros**: Diversification, professional management
**Cons**: Higher fees, less control

### ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds)

Similar to mutual funds but traded like stocks throughout the day. Most ETFs track an index (like the S&P 500) rather than being actively managed.

**Pros**: Low fees, diversification, easy to buy/sell
**Cons**: Trading costs (though many brokers now offer free trades)

### Index Funds

A type of mutual fund or ETF that tracks a market index. Instead of trying to beat the market, index funds aim to match it.

**Why they work**: Most actively managed funds underperform index funds over time, after fees.

<Callout type="tip">
For most beginners, low-cost index funds are the best starting point. They provide instant diversification and typically outperform more expensive alternatives.
</Callout>

## Understanding Risk and Return

### The Risk-Return Tradeoff

Higher potential returns come with higher risk. This is fundamental to investing:

- **Savings account**: ~4% return, virtually no risk
- **Bonds**: ~4-6% return, low risk
- **Stocks**: ~8-10% historical return, higher risk

### Diversification

"Don't put all your eggs in one basket." Diversification means spreading investments across:

- Different asset types (stocks, bonds)
- Different industries (tech, healthcare, finance)
- Different countries (US, international)
- Different company sizes (large, medium, small)

A single index fund can provide all this diversification instantly.

### Time Reduces Risk

The stock market goes up and down, but historically trends upward over long periods:

- 1 year: Market can be up or down 30%+
- 10 years: Very rarely negative
- 20+ years: Historically always positive

This is why time horizon matters so much.

## Where to Invest

### Employer 401(k)

If your employer offers a 401(k), especially with a match, start here.

**Benefits**:
- Tax advantages (traditional or Roth)
- Employer match = free money
- Automatic payroll deduction
- Higher contribution limits ($23,000 in 2024)

**Priority**: At minimum, contribute enough to get the full employer match.

### IRA (Individual Retirement Account)

Additional retirement savings beyond your 401(k):

**Traditional IRA**: Tax deduction now, pay taxes in retirement
**Roth IRA**: Pay taxes now, tax-free in retirement

Both have a $7,000 annual limit (2024), with $1,000 extra if over 50.

### Taxable Brokerage Account

For investing beyond retirement accounts:

- No contribution limits
- No early withdrawal penalties
- Pay taxes on dividends and capital gains

Good for medium-term goals or if you've maxed retirement accounts.

## How to Start: A Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Choose Your Investment Account

For most beginners:
1. **First priority**: 401(k) up to employer match
2. **Second priority**: Roth IRA (if eligible based on income)
3. **Third priority**: Max out 401(k)
4. **Fourth priority**: Taxable brokerage

### Step 2: Select a Brokerage

Popular options for beginners:
- Fidelity
- Vanguard
- Charles Schwab

Look for:
- No account minimums
- Low or no trading fees
- Good selection of low-cost index funds
- User-friendly interface

### Step 3: Choose Your Investments

For a simple, effective portfolio, consider a "three-fund portfolio":

1. **US Total Stock Market Index Fund** (50-70%)
2. **International Stock Index Fund** (15-25%)
3. **US Bond Index Fund** (10-30%)

Or even simpler: A target-date retirement fund that adjusts automatically as you approach retirement.

### Step 4: Set Up Automatic Contributions

Automate your investing:
- Set up regular transfers from checking to brokerage
- Enable automatic investment in your chosen funds
- Increase contributions when you get raises

### Step 5: Stay the Course

The hardest part of investing is doing nothing during market volatility:

- Don't panic sell during downturns
- Don't try to time the market
- Don't check your balance daily
- Do rebalance once a year if needed
- Do continue investing regularly

## Common Beginner Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Waiting Too Long to Start

Time in the market beats timing the market. Starting with $50/month is better than waiting until you have more.

### Mistake 2: Trying to Pick Individual Stocks

Most professionals can't consistently beat the market. Stick with index funds.

### Mistake 3: Panic Selling

Market drops are normal and temporary. Selling locks in losses. Stay invested.

### Mistake 4: Paying High Fees

A 1% fee difference can cost tens of thousands over a lifetime. Stick with low-cost index funds (look for expense ratios under 0.2%).

### Mistake 5: Not Diversifying

Betting everything on one stock or sector is gambling, not investing.

### Mistake 6: Checking Too Often

Daily portfolio checks lead to emotional decisions. Check quarterly at most.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much should I invest?

Start with whatever you can afford after building an emergency fund. Even $25/month helps. Aim to eventually invest 15-20% of income.

### Is now a good time to invest?

Time in the market matters more than timing. Start now and invest consistently.

### What if the market crashes?

Market crashes are buying opportunities if you have a long time horizon. Keep investing through downturns—you're buying stocks "on sale."

### Should I use a financial advisor?

Most beginners can DIY with index funds. If you want help, look for fee-only fiduciary advisors (not commission-based salespeople).
